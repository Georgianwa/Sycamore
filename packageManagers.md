## Package managers other than npm and yarn:
1. Bun
2. PNPM

## Comparisons
| Package manager | pros | cons
| --------------- | ---- | ---- |
| npm | 1. It saves developers time and effort and makes development faster | 1. It can cause dependency conflicts and versioning issues when too many dependencies or packages are installed.
|     | 2. It allows developers easily manage different versions of packages or dependencies which helps in effectively maintaining compatibility between different parts of an application. | 2.The packages installed from npm rely on third-party code that the developer has no control over and this makes fixing bugs, if the package maintainers are unresponsive, difficult.

| PNPM | 1. It is a faster method than npm. | 1. Some packages or tools are optimized for npm and may not be compatible with pnpm's structure.
|      | 2. It optimizes disk space usage.  | 2. pnpm has a more complex structure which can make manual inspection more difficult.
