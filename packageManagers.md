## Comparisons
| Package manager | pros | cons
| --------------- | ---- | ---- |
| npm | 1. It saves developers time and effort and makes development faster | 1. It can cause dependency conflicts and versioning issues when too many dependencies or packages are installed
|     | 2. It allows developers easily manage different versions of packages or dependencies which helps in effectively maintaining compatibility between different parts of an application | 2.The packages installed from npm rely on third-party code that the developer has no control over and this makes fixing bugs, if the package maintainers are unresponsive, difficult.
